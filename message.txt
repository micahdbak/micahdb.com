Hello, world!

My name is Micah Baker. I am a passionate software developer, with a keen
interest in systems programming, networking, and a little bit of design. I am
in my second year of studying Computing Science at Simon Fraser University.
In this website, you will be able to find projects that I have worked on, and
projects that I have completed.

Thanks for visiting.

Micah
